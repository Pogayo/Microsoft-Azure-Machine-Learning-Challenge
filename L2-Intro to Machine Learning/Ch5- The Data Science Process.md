**Lesson 2: Intro to Machine Learning**

# Chapter 5 - The Data Science Process

## Data collection 
**Developer Activities:** Writing code to retrieve files, querying databases, calling web-services, or scraping web pages
## Data preparation 
  * Data wrangling to get the data in a suitable format for analysis
  * Exploring and understanding the data
  * Identifying and creating features  needed for the model

**Developer Activities:** Writing code to clean the data eg impute values, compute aggregate metrics, visualizing the data
## Training the model
  * Select an algorithm
  * Prepare the training, testing and validating datasets
  * Iteratively evaluate the model to identify the best performing version and sanity check the outcome.

**Developer Activities:** Setting up the model pipeline eg feature vectorization, feature scaling and tuning the algorithm
## Evaluate the model
**Developer Activities:** Writing code to test the performance and do some math
## Deploy the model 
Deploy as a webservice or API
**Developer Activities:** Scripts for maintaining and monitoring, DevOps activities
## Retrain the model
On fresh data
