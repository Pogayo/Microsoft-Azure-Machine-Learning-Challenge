**Lesson 2: Intro to Machine Learning**

# Chapter 3 - Applications of Machine Learning Notes

>The applications of machine learning are extremely broad, diverse and cut across industries! 
> Some popular industries are healthcare, finance, manufacturing, retail, government, and education.
 
For all these applications, there are several techniques that are frequently used that include statistical machine learning,deep learning and reinforcement learning.
 
ML is very useful in Natural Language Processing(NLP) applications dealing with text and speech.
NLP can be used to summarize texts, power search, automatically detect topics, identify if two texts are similar and translate one langauge to another. 
With regards to speech, NLP powers applications such as speech to text which converts human speech to text and vice versa.

ML also powers computer vision applications such as self-driving cars, describing the contents of an image(Object detection), locating specific objects within an image(Object Identification).
Computer Vision can do this with images created with visible image spectrum as well as other image types such as LIDAR that are collected using laser scanners. 

ML powers analytics applications that help make prediction performing tasks such as regression, classification, forecasting and clustering.

ML also useful for decision making. Whether these are sequential problems such as video games, or optimizing content recommendations based on user interaction.

## Examples of Applied Machine Learning
Machine learning is used to solve an extremely diverse range of problems. Here are some examples:

### Automate the recognition of disease
Trained physicians can only review and evaluate a limited volume of patients or patient images (X-rays, sonograms, etc.). Machine learning can be used to spot the disease, hence reducing physician burnout. For example, [Google has trained a deep learning model](https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/03/03/google-computers-trained-to-detect-cancer/) to detect breast cancer and [Stanford researchers have used deep learning models](https://news.stanford.edu/2017/01/25/artificial-intelligence-used-identify-skin-cancer/) to diagnose skin cancer.

### Recommend next best actions for individual care plans
With the mass digitization of patient data via systems that use [EMRs (Electronic Medical Records) and EHRs (Electronic Health Records)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_health_record), machine learning can be used to help build effective individual care plans. For example, [IBM Watson Oncology](https://www.ibm.com/products/clinical-decision-support-oncology) can help clinicians explore potential treatment options. More examples can be found [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicolemartin1/2019/08/30/how-healthcare-is-using-big-data-and-ai-to-cure-disease/#64671f7e45cf).

### Enable personalized, real-time banking experiences with chatbots
ML can be used to intercept and handle common, straightforward issues through chat and messaging services, so customers can quickly and independently resolve simple issues that would otherwise have required human intervention. With the chatbot, a customer can simply type in a question and the bot engages to surface the answer.
Refer to [this article](https://www.drift.com/learn/chatbot/ai-chatbots/) to for more information about chatbot powered machine learning.

### Identify the next best action for the customer
Real-time insights that incorporate machine learning tools—such as [sentiment analysis](https://www.concur.com/newsroom/article/machine-learning-with-heart-how-sentiment-analysis-can-help-your) —can help organizations assess the likelihood of a deal closing or the level of a customer’s loyalty. [Personally-tailored recommendations](https://medium.com/@madasamy/introduction-to-recommendation-systems-and-how-to-design-recommendation-system-that-resembling-the-9ac167e30e95) powered by machine learning can engage and delight customers with information and offers that are relevant to them.

### Capture, prioritize, and route service requests to the correct employee, and improve response times
A busy government organization gets innumerable service requests on an annual basis. Machine learning tools can help to capture incoming service requests, to route them to the correct employee in real-time, to refine prioritization, and improve response times.
