# Chapter 8 - Scaling  Data
> Scaling means transforming data so that it can fit some range or scale
> Scaling can speed up training process and improve accuracy of a model.
> Two common approaches to scaling data include **standardization** and **normalization**.
## Standardization
Rescales the data to have a mean of zero and a variance of 1.

#### Formula 
Z= (x-μ)/σ

Standard score=(Observed value - mean)/standard deviation

## Normalization
Rescales the data into a range of [0-1]

#### Formula 
(𝑥 −𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛)/(𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥 −𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛)
