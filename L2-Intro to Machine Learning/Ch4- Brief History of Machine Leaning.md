**Lesson 2: Intro to Machine Learning**

# Chapter 4 - Brief History of Machine Learning

- As AI was emerging in the 50's, there was a perception that computers will be smarter than humans by the 2000's.
It  soon was realised that limitations of computing power and algorithms were so serious that it would take longer.
- In the 80's there was a shift to specific areas of AI- Machine Learning being one of them.
One of the machine learning algorithms being designed and developed was neural nets-inspired by the human brain
- In 2010's the availability of superior computing power in the form of GPU's revived research in neural nets
The term *deep learning* was coined because the neural nets were large and had many hidden layers.

DESCRIPTION | TERM
