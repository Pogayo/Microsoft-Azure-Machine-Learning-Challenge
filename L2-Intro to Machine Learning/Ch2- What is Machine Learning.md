**Lesson 2: Intro to Machine Learning**

# Chapter 2 - What is Machine Learning Notes

>Machine learning is a data science technique used to extract patterns from data, allowing computers to identify related data, and forecast future outcomes, behaviors, and trends.

Machine Learning  | Traditional Programming
------------ | ------------
Data and answers as input and system returns rules as output | Data and hard-coded rules as input and system returns answers as output

### Limitations of traditional programming 
- We might not always come up with the best rules. The power of machine learning is that it can use historical data and generate rules that we might not have thought about
- It is very difficult to write high performing treaditional programs for applications such as fraud detection, object detection, speech recognition, recommendation engine etc

Machine learning allows computers to learn automatically based on observation or data.

ML is best suited for applications such as pattern recognition, anomaly detection. time series forecasting, and recommendation systems

## Q and A
1. What type of approach is shown in this image?
- [x] Traditional programming
- [ ] Machine Learning
2.  What type of approach is shown in this image?
- [ ] Traditional programming
- [x] Machine Learning
3. Imagine you want to create a function that multiplies two numbers together (e.g., given the inputs 2 and 3, the function will generate the output 6). What approach is best suited to this problem?
- [x] Traditional programming
- [ ] Machine Learning
4. Now imagine that you have some images that contain handwritten numbers. You want to create a program that will recognize which number is in each picture, but you're not sure exactly what characteristics can be used to best tell the numbers apart. Which is the best approach for creating this program?

- [ ] Traditional programming
- [x] Machine Learning

5. In traditional programming, the inputs of hard-coded rules and data are used to arrive at the output of answers, but in machine learning the approach is quite different. Mark all of the options below that are true statements about machine learning.

- [x] Data is an input to train an algorithm
- [x] Historical answers are an input to train an algorith
- [ ] Rules are explicitly programmed
- [x] Rules are the output learned by the algorithm
