**Lesson 5: Applications of Machine Learning**

# Chapter 2 - Deep Learning Vs Classical Machine Learning

Deep learning algorithms are a special case of machine learning  algorithms that have the capability to learn complex, non-linear functions from data. 

# Chapter 3 - What is Deep Learning?
>Deep learning algorithms are a special case of machine learning  algorithms based on artificial neural networks that have the capability to learn complex, non-linear functions from data. 
- Deep learning are a subset of the broader neural network categories. The other neural nets are called shallow neural networks
- Artificial neural networks were inspired from the brain

# Chapter 4 - Characteristics of deep learning
- Can handle massives amount of data
- Excels with raw, unstructured data
- Automatic feature extraction
- Computationally expensive

# Chapter 6 - Benefits and applications of deep learning
## Benefits
- Non-parametric approach allows taken by neural nets it to learn arbitrarily complex  functions
- Can learn complex patterns without explicitly seeing them
- Effective across various forms of data(text, tabular, image)
- Works on very large datasets
- Can be distributed for parallel trainining
- Lately, can learn patterns that are time-related(RNN)
- Capable of reaching on par- performance with humans on certain activities
## Applications
- Language translation
- Image recognition
- Speech recognition
- Forecasting
- Autonomous vehicles
- Predictive analytics
- Text: Sentiment analysis, clustering, classification, search, semantics, summarization
