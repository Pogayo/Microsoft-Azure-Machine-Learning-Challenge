**Lesson 3:Model Training**

# Chapter 21- Training Classifiers

A classification problem occurs when the expected output are categorical(discrete).

## Categories of classification problems
- Binary Classification - Classify medical test results as "positive" or "negative".
- Multiclass single label classification - Classify an image as one (and only one) of five possible fruits.
- Multiclass multilabel classification - Classify music as belonging to multiple groups (e.g., "upbeat", "jazzy", "pop"). 

## Examples of Classification algorithms
- Logistic regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)


# Chapter 22 - Training Regressors
In a regression problem, the output is numerical or continuous.

## Categories
- Regression to arbitrary values
- Regression to values within the range of 0-1 eg  predicting the probability that a user will like classical music

## Examples of Regression algorithms
- Linear regressor
- Decision tree regressor
